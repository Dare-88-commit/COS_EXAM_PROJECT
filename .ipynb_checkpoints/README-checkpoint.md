# COS_EXAM_PROJECT
Name: Smart Task Scheduler
Purpose : The Smart Task Scheduler app is developed as a solution to help Pan-Atlantic Computer Science students to manage their task properly. The app helps the students to be highly efficient an time concious while trying to achieve their tasks(both academic and non-academic tasks). It is a simple and user-friendly desktop app built using Python and TKinterto assist users in organizing their daily responsibilities based on priority and deadlines.This app also efficiently prioritizes your tasks as guided.

Goals : To create a task management tool that helps students prioritize tasks.
        To reinforce Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python.
        To gain practical experience using Tkinter for GUI application development.
        To design a simple and user friendly task management app.
        
Technology Stack : Programming Language: Python 3.x
                   GUI Toolkit: Tkinter
                   Modules Used: datetime (for managing deadlines and urgency)
                                 tkinter.messagebox (for user input validation and alerts)
                                 tkinter.ttk (for task display using Treeview)
System Features: Add task- a.Task title
                           b. Optional Description
                           c. Priority Level (e.g., 1 = High, 2 = Medium, 3 = Low)
                           d. Deadline (Date and Time)
                           e. Estimated Duration (in minutes or hours)
                 Edit and Delete Task- Select a task from the list to modify or remove it.
                 Task Sorting- Automatically sorts tasks by priority and urgency (how close the deadline is).
                               Sort by letters and key words using the search bar.
                 Visual Indicators- Red highlight: Overdue tasks
                                    Yellow highlight: Urgent tasks (due within 24 hours)  
                 Input Validation- Prevents submission of empty fields or incorrect formats (e.g., wrong date format, invalid priority                                          value).
How to Use the Application: 1. Launch the App (via Python or .exe if compiled)
                            2. Enter Task Details(Task name, Description, Priority, Date/Time) in the input fields.
                            3. Click "Add Task" to save it to the task list.
                            4. To trace task click use the search box(Type the keyword then click enter).
                            5. View tasks in the list; urgent and overdue tasks will be visually marked.
                            6. To edit or delete, click on the task and use the corresponding button.
Future Improvements: 1. Add persistent storage (save/load tasks to file)
                     2. Add task filtering (e.g., only show high priority)
                     3. Add reminders or notifications
                     4. Enable calendar view
Conclusion: The Smart Task Scheduler demonstrates the application of OOP and GUI programming principles to solve a real-world problem faced by students. The interface is designed to be intuitive and visually informative, making it easier for users to stay on top of their tasks and manage their time more effectively. This project is a very influencial one as it can be used not just by Pan-Atlantic stuents but by career based personel, organisations etc.
